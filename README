# The extra lightweight dependencies installer

You define your dependencies in a file named `dependencies.json` at top
of your project. This file is an associative array or keys defining the
folders in your project that needs to be created and values pointing to
urls of third-party release artifacts.  The fragment part in the url
can added to point a subdirectory in the release (eg a src/ folder).

Then run `install-dependencies`.

Currently only zip releases are supported.

Example of a dependencies.json file
 
     {
       "library/Zend":
         "https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/archive/release-1.12.3.zip#library/Zend",
       "library/PHPThumb":
         "https://github.com/masterexploder/PHPThumb/archive/v1.0-final.zip#src",
       "modules/smoke-test":
         "https://bitbucket.org/mat/smoke-test/get/e519fae15059.zip#smoke-test"
     }
