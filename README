# The extra lightweight dependencies installer

You define your dependencies in a file named `dependencies.json`
at top of your project. This file is an object with
keys defining what folder has to be created and values is a url pointing to
a third-party release. The fragment part in the url can added to
point a subdirectory in the release (eg a src/ folder).

Currently only zip releases are supported.

Example of a dependencies.json file
 
     {
       "library/Zend": "https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/archive/release-1.12.3.zip#library/Zend",
       "modules/smoke-test": "https://bitbucket.org/mat/smoke-test/get/e519fae15059.zip#smoke-test"
     }
